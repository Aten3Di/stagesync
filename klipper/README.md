# Configuration:

### [stagesync]
Support for additional heaters synced to the temperatures of a primary heater (any number of sections can be defined with a "stagesync" prefix).
```
[stagesync main_heater_name]
#stages: stage1, stage2
#   Define the name of the additional heater to synchronize with the main heater.
#   If there are more than one heaters, they must be divided with a comma.
#   This parameter must be provided.
#temp_ratio: 1.0, 0.9
#   Defines the target temperature multiplier value of each heater synchronized
#   with the master heater. Specifies a percentage of the main heater target
#   temperature to apply to the supplemental heaters. Each value corresponds to
#   the respective heater divided by a comma. The value range is from 0 (0%) to
#   2.00 (200%). This value is optional and if not defined a multiplier of 1.0
#   will be applied.
